# Online Karaoke Test

This is a simple test implementation of an online karaoke system using WebRTC and Web Audio API.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to the "Pages" section
   - Select the main branch as the source
   - Save the changes

## Usage

1. Open the deployed GitHub Pages URL in your web browser.
2. Click the "Start Karaoke" button to begin.
3. Allow microphone access when prompted.
4. Start singing! The lyrics will appear on the screen, and your score will update in real-time.

## Note

This is a test implementation and requires a backend server to function properly. The current code points to a placeholder server URL ('https://your-karaoke-server.com') which needs to be replaced with an actual server implementation.

## Limitations

- This demo doesn't include actual song playback or sophisticated scoring algorithms.
- It's meant to demonstrate the basic structure and concepts of an online karaoke system.
